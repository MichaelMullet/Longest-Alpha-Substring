# The Longest Alphabetical Substring
### *A program that finds the longest alphabetical substring in a string of letters.*
This program takes a user entered string of letters and finds the longest substring of letters are arranged alphabetically from a to z.

I made this as a project for an MITx course on Python and computer science, and it was the first one I ever built on my own.
